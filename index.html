            <h2 class="school">Iowa State University</h2>
            <p>My name is Gavin Sands and I am currently a student at Iowa State University. I am majoring in Computer Science with minor in Applied AI and Artificial Intelligence.
                I am from a small town in northern Illinois called Rock Falls. Ever since I was young, I have always been passionate for technology and computers. 
                When I was in 6th grade, I built my first computer and have been hooked since. Now, I am currently a sophomore and still have that same passion I did since
                I was a kid!

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The first project I built was based on a card game. The game was called War. I used java to develop the logic, and now that I am becoming more familiar
                with css, html, and javascript, I plan on remaking the game to be web based.
